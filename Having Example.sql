Huh... SQL doesn't understand the COUNT of orders before it's finished grouping them together...
Makes sense!
WHERE clauses have to come before GROUP BY so I guess we'll have to use something else...

HAVING!

HAVING works here because it's like WHERE, it can ask a question of the data and filter on it
But it comes after the GROUP BY clause and can therefore refer to aggregated data in it's statement
